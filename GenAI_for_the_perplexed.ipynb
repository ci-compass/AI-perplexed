    "Think of an LLM as a kind of supercharged text predictor: you give it a sequence of tokens (words or subwords) and it predicts the next token, then the next, etc. What we call the context window is simply how many tokens the model can look back at when making each prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a model has a context window of, say, 4,096 tokens, then when it’s about to predict token N, it only “knows” about tokens N-4,095 through N-1 (plus whatever internal state) — it cannot directly “see” tokens older than that.\n",

    "### Why does the Context Window Matter?\n",
    "1. **Scope of what the model knows in this invocation -- Stateless Model**\n",
    "> Because the model cannot remember everything ever said, only what fits into its window — if you want it to reference a piece of text, you must include it (or a compressed version of it) in the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Management of context = performance trade-offs**\n",
    "> The more tokens you feed (longer history, more retrieved docs, more examples), the richer the information the model has — but you are limited by the window size. If you exceed it, older tokens get truncated (lost). If you fill it with irrelevant stuff, you can confuse the model (context noise) rather than help it. Karpathy calls this “the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analogy: human coworker with short-term memory**\n",
    "> Karpathy uses an analogy: the LLM is like a coworker who has anterograde amnesia — they forget everything beyond a short timeframe. So if you want them to reference something older, you must remind them (i.e., re-include it in the window)."
